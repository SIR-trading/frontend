          APE tokens lock in <a href="https://x.com/leveragesir/status/1903585913189421304" className="underline" target="_blank">perfect constant leverage</a>. No funding fees,
          no periodic rebalancing, no margin calls. You pay one fee at
          mint, and thereafter your position is free to hold.
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as the vault has sufficient liquidity, routine swings
          don&apos;t erode returns. Your leveraged gains can compound unhindered over time.

          Pay a one-time entry fee to mint TEA and join a vault.

        <p>
          As an LPer, if the &lsquo;long&rsquo; token climbs you lose value when measured in that token but gain when measured in the &lsquo;versus&rsquo; token;
          and if the &lsquo;long&rsquo; token falls, the effect reverses. This balance makes TEA a good fit when you are undecided about going long or short.
        </p>
        <p>
          You collect the fees leverage traders pay whenever they mint or burn APE,
          and selected vaults add <a href="https://docs.sir.trading/protocol-overview/sir-a-dividend-paying-token" className="underline" target="_blank">SIR token</a> rewards on top.
          Burn TEA at any time to withdraw your funds.

          and claim SIR rewards earned from liquidity vaults.
        </p>

          You can also stake or unstake SIR here to collect your ETH dividends.

          Stake SIR to receive a share of all protocol fees, which are automatically converted to ETH before distribution.
          Your dividends can be claimed at any moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon staking, your SIR is locked but unlocks continuously, with &frac12; of the balance becoming withdrawable every 30 days.

          Lower exponents need little liquidity,

        <p>
          The calculator shows what your APE position would return after mint and fee, so you can size trades before committing real funds.

        <p>
          When the timer closes, the highest bidder receives the tokens and the ETH moves to the dividend pool for SIR stakers.
